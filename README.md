# Events Ticketmaster Web Application

This is a web application that allows users to search for events using the Ticketmaster API. It includes functionality for listing events, viewing event details, and searching for events. The application is built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React, Zustand for state management, Axios, and React Query for data fetching and caching. The application also includes a skeleton loading effect to improve the user experience while loading data.

The application is deployed on Netlify and can be accessed at [https://assessment-ticketmaster.netlify.app/](https://assessment-ticketmaster.netlify.app/).
